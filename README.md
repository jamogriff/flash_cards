#  Flash Cards
#### A scalable flash-cards game designed with OOP and TDD principles. Design guidelines were written by Turing and can be [found here](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/flashcards).

### Playing the Game
New cards can be added to the `cards.txt` file in the `data` directory. The current iteration only allows a correct answer if it matches the answer listed *exactly*. To begin, execute `flashcard_runner.rb` in a Terminal session.
